| [Documentation](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-apps-staffcheckins/wiki/Home) | [Deployment guide](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-apps-staffcheckins/wiki/Deployment-Guide) | [Architecture](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-apps-staffcheckins/wiki/Solution-Overview) |

First-line staff in organizations typically need to communicate and check-in with their teams periodically with time-critical updates. Whether you run a construction business, landscaping, cleaning company, a delivery service, or any other business with field personnel, you need to provide your staff with an easy way to check-in with their latest status on their work. The Staff Check-ins is a Power App that provides a simple workflow where staff can check-in with a photo, location, and other details directly from Microsoft Teams.

With the app, managers or supervisors can get task updates or check-ins from employees on a schedule or an ad-hoc basis. The staff check-in can include real-time location, photos, and notes.

## Key features

 -  Managers/Supervisors can set up a one- time or recurring occurrence of a check-in request
 -  Access all the information about the team in one place and track progress - validate locations and photos to ensure that your employees are pushing accurate data
 -  Automate operations workflow by triggering reminder notifications for end-users on Microsoft Teams

Here are some of the workflows in action:

1) A manager creates a check-in request by specifying the check-in frequency and the team name through the app

2) All the team members are notified of the check-in request through a notification delivered via Power Automate in the team's General channel

3) End users can quickly navigate to the app to provide the check-in details

4) Managers can view summarized check-in status of team members and view details if required
